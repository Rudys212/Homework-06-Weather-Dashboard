# Weather Dashboard
## **Description**  
-------------
Weather Dashboard is an application to check the weather in a city. The application was built using the third-party API- _OpenWeather_.
The application makes requests to this API and is able to show the current weather and a 5 day forecast. 

 ## **How to Use**
 ---------------
- The user would start at the homepage where they are able to enter the city they want to look the weather up for. There the _Current Weather Section_ will show the weather at that moment. 
-This would also produce a five day forecast for the weather. 

-A user would have their recent searches saved under the search button. There they are able to easily access past searches.  

  -At the bottom, the user will find the graph with their history of transaction by date.
